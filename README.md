# SimpleEmoji

A large collection of ruby aliases for emojis and special symbols. Use Simple Emoji instead of using unreadable unicode characters starting with &#. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'simple_emoji'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simple_emoji

## Usage

emoji = SimpleEmoji::Index.new

emoji.grinning_face
 => ðŸ˜€
emoji.winking_face
 => ðŸ˜œ
emoji.tears_of_joy
 => ðŸ˜‚

## Development
A emoji is enclosed within a span tag. The actual code rendered is `"<span class=\"emoji-winking-face\">&#128521</span>"` which gives flexibility for css. 

&#128521 is the decimal code for the emoji ðŸ˜œ
